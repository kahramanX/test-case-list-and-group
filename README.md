# test-case-list-and-group
Hello, I tried to make this test case in accordance with the conditions. Front-end: React, Back-end: Nodejs, Database: MongoDB.
I tried to componentize each button and pane and fit them into a suitable architecture. I tried to make it easier to read and write code by setting props and styles suitable for the components.
Note: I tried to make the application as asynchronous as possible, but since I don't use the react query package, you may need to refresh the page for some operations.
